# User-Manager
This is a CRUD based User Manager Where users can View, Create, Delete or Update User Info from a database. The whole project uses python and sqlite3. The UI is made using Tkinter Library. 

# How-To-Run-It
You can download the user_manager.exe file from the repo and just run it directly on your computer.

# Instructions on using the child datas
You have to select a parent from the list of parents before you can create a child. If no parent is selcted then no child will be added to the child table in the database. Deleting a child will always delete all the identical childs (childs with same ID, First Name, Last Name). Deleting a parent will delete all the child associated with it by id.
